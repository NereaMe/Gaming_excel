# GameCo.
I am an analyst for a new video game company, GameCo, which wants to use data to inform the development of new games.
A descriptive analysis of a video game dataset was conducted to gain insights into potential market performance. 
This analysis was crucial in identifying potential misallocations of resources due to incorrect data interpretation. 
I could identify the best-performing markets and develop a new strategy.

_Status Quo_
GameCo currently prioritizes NA (North America) as the most significant market, allocating the majority of the budget to it, based on its historical dominance.
When analyzing yearly sales, a distinct perspective emerges, revealing how they have misinterpreted their numbers.
_RECOMMENDATIONS_
Sales per country have evolved YoY Europe surpassed North America in 2017, prompting an increase in resources there. Japan, though ranked third, maintains a stable market, suggesting a proportional allocation
We'll adjust allocations based on changing markets, starting with reallocating by popular categories as shown in Graph 2.
